        Renowned gospel artiste, Sonnie Badu , has shared details of how his wife almost fainted when she received news of his traumatic accident in 2023. In an interview with Kingdom FM, he opened up about the aftermath of the domestic accident that resulted in the loss of two toes on his right foot. According to Sonnie Badu , the moment he informed his pregnant wife about the accident, he tried to downplay the severity to avoid alarming her. However, when she saw the extent of his injuries, she was overwhelmed and nearly passed out. “When it happened, I called my wife and I was smiling at her because she was pregnant and you've got to be careful what news you tell her. So, I said it was a small accident. She said she wanted to see it. When I showed it to her, she almost passed out. She wept because it was a lot to handle,” he said. Despite the surgery and the physical challenges that followed, Badu shared that he forced himself to preach at two churches, delivering three hours at one and four hours at another. He also shared that he attended a five-hour rehearsal the same evening, demonstrating his commitment to his craft. He added that he wasn’t surprised by comments questioning the authenticity of his injury, but he remained focused on his responsibilities and his passion for his ministry.
